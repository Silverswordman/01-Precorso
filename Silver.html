        My name is Giulia, I'm almost 30 yrs old and I'm a huge nerd ,
         I studied many things in my life at first i studied foreign languages in highschool then i chose to follow my artistic side going to the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome.
         <br>
         My main hobbies and passions are in this order:
        
         <ul>
            <li>cosplaying</li>
            <li>gaming</li>
            <li>watching or reading pop/nerd things </li>
            <li>sewing </li>
            <li>walking with my dog </li> 
            <li>listening to music </li>
            
         </ul>
       

        

        </div>
        </p>
        <br>

    The only way to advance is sometimes going back to you roots, and mines are incredibly intertwined with computers. My dad working with IBM always brought
     the electronics and the digital world in my life so much that I just recently discovered that not all 90s kids like me had videogames and computer access when they were 6 yrs old.
     
    Maybe programming is my way to go? I already had some micro experience on html editing with old forums , I didn't know at all what i was doing but i loved trying to understand 
    what code was doing what on the layout and graphics, experimenting and crashing sometimes all the structure.

    My passion for arts, sewing and all handmade things is just a reflection of my love for patience, precision and problems solving (not all things work as manuals say
    but you have to make them work) and i think it could translate well on the programming world.
